    <title>Episode 2 - Bundler and packages</title>
</head>

<body>
    <!-- NPM: NPM is not node package manager it manages packages -->

    <!-- Bundler: Bundler basically bundles your appp, it packages your app properly so that it can be shipped to production. Ex: Parcel, vite, webpack -->

    <!-- npm install -D parcel -->

    <!-- npm install: for node_modules -->

    <!-- Two types of packages: 1. dev dependency: It is required for developnment phase, 2. Normal dependency: It is used in production phase -->

    <!-- Caret: Caret helps in updating minor version updates -->
    <!-- tilde: tilde helps in updating major version updates -->

    <!-- package.json is a configuration -->

    <!-- Difference between package.json and package-lock.json is package.json keeps track of the approx version and package-lock.json keeps track of the exact version. -->

    <!-- package-lock.json is a important file bcoz the dependencies version should be accurate which is in local version the same version should be on the production level otherwise the code will break -->

    <!-- Transitive dependencies: A dependency which has their own dependency and that dependency can have their own dependency is known as transitive dependencies  -->

    <!-- Node modules is kind of a database it contains the actual data of the dependencies that our project needs -->

    <!-- node modules: Even if we delete node_modules we can regenerate it at any point of project. That is why we do not push node_modules into github but we have to put package.json and package-lock.json int github -->

    <!-- npx parcel index.html : to run in localhost -->

    <!-- npx means executing a package -->

    <!-- it is good to install react and react dom inside npm package.json coz it is easy to manage react and react-dom inside package rather than using cdn -->
